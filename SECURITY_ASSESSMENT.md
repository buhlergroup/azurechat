**Assessment Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Vulnerability:** CVE-2025-61686 (Critical - CVSS 9.8)  
**Status:** ✅ NOT AFFECTED

## Executive Summary

This repository has been assessed for the critical React Router vulnerability (CVE-2025-61686) that allows attackers to access or modify server files via directory traversal. **The repository is NOT affected by this vulnerability.**

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2025-61686 Overview
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS v3 Score: 9.8)
- **Attack Vector:** Network-based
- **Flaw Type:** Remote Code Execution / Denial of Service / Unauthorized File Access

### Affected Packages
The vulnerability affects the following packages:

| Package Name | Affected Versions | Fixed Version |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `@react-router/node` | 7.0.0 through 7.9.3 | 7.9.4 or later |
| `@remix-run/deno` | 2.17.1 and earlier | 2.17.2 or later |
| `@remix-run/node` | 2.17.1 and earlier | 2.17.2 or later |

### Attack Vector
The vulnerability exists in the `createFileSessionStorage()` function when used with unsigned cookies. Attackers can manipulate session cookies to force the application to read or write files outside the designated session directory through directory traversal.

## Assessment Results

### Technology Stack Analysis
This application uses:
- **Framework:** Next.js (version 16.1.0)
- **Routing:** Next.js built-in App Router
- **Session Management:** next-auth (version 4.24.13)

### Dependency Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of the repository's dependencies was performed:

1. **Direct Dependencies:** No React Router or Remix packages found in `package.json`
2. **Transitive Dependencies:** No indirect dependencies on vulnerable packages found in `package-lock.json`
3. **Full Dependency Tree:** Verified using `npm list --all` - no React Router or Remix packages detected

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check for vulnerable packages
npm list --all 2>&1 | grep -iE "react-router|remix"
# Result: No React Router or Remix dependencies found

# Check package-lock.json
cat package-lock.json | jq '.packages | to_entries[] | select(.key | contains("react-router") or contains("remix"))'
# Result: No matches found
```

## Conclusion

**This repository is NOT vulnerable to CVE-2025-61686** because:

1. ✅ The application uses Next.js for routing, not React Router or Remix
2. ✅ None of the vulnerable packages are present as direct dependencies
3. ✅ None of the vulnerable packages are present as transitive dependencies
4. ✅ The application does not use `createFileSessionStorage()` function

## Recommendations

While this repository is not affected by this specific vulnerability:

1. **Continue Monitoring:** Keep track of security advisories for all dependencies
2. **Regular Updates:** Maintain up-to-date dependencies using `npm audit` and `npm update`
3. **Security Scanning:** Integrate automated security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation:** Keep this security assessment updated when major framework changes occur
